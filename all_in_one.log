Utilization Rates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure saved to billing/figures/utilization_rates.pdf
p65.6 CPU utilization rate is  0.49950999999999995
More than 65% of requests use less than 50% of the allocated CPU.
p76 memory utilization rate is  0.499313359375
Around 76% of requests use less than 50% of the allocated memory.
The CPU and memory utilization rates show a Pearson correlation of 0.552.
The CPU and memory utilization rates show a Spearman correlation of 0.565.

Invocation Fees and Billing Granularities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On AWS Lambda, a fixed invocation fee of 2.0000000000000002e-07 is equivalent to 96.0ms of billable wall-clock time for a function with the default 128MB memory configuration.
Number of requests with execution times of at least 1ms: 527054654
Number of requests with execution times of at least 1ms: 527054654
